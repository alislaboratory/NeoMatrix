# NeoMatrix - A customisable desktop RGB LED Matrix.

NeoMatrix is an interface for an RGB LED matrix with a web interface, running off a Rasberry Pi.
It runs on Flask and Python, and is completely customisable. I set out to have it as a cool-desktop cryptocurrency ticker, but realised its potential once I started playing around with the code.

It has a locally hosted web interface where all the features can be modified. It's quite simple but works great at the moment, so I may consider updating it to look a bit better in future. 

I have also included the 3D model for a case. The HUB75 32x16 LED matrix slots in by friction and can be optionally secured by M3 screws. I printed it in PLA on a Bambu Lab X1C with supports and 15% infill. You could probably get away with less infill, as it doesn't have really much weight to support.

The Raspberry Pi and wiring simply is shoved in the back of the case, and there is a slot at the back for the power wires (and others if you would like) to come out. It sits on the desk at a 60ยบ angle pretty comfortably and the Raspberry Pi shouldn't need much cooling. In future, I may design a better case that supports a fan and some ventilation slots to prevent overheating, though this is unlikely anyways. 

See my YouTube video on it: {insert YT video when done}

Have fun! You're welcome to play around with the code and add some cool features. At the moment, I would like to add some cool ambient animations, like fire, or an ocean or something like that. Some games that can be played on the web interface would also be pretty cool, or even if they could just be ambiently played automatically.
